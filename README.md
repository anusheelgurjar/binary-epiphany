Binary Epiphany Beta v1.0

Binary Epiphany is a tool made with Processing that adds a captivating twist to image processing. This tool takes two images and employs a Bayer Matrix order system to dither them before applying the Difference blendMode(), resulting in a surprising series of patterns, tessellations, and moirÃ© effects. Users have the flexibility to experiment with settings such as Matrix Size, Pixel Size, Contrast, Threshold, and Rotation to explore various iterations and creative possibilities.

Hi there!

> Along with the tool is a folder named "Sample Images", containing some gradient maps to play around with.

> The imported images can be either be in colour or grayscale. Both works, however the output is only in grayscale.

> Feel free to share feedback or any other concerns on anusheel1625@gmail.com

> If you produce any artwork with the tool, please share it to @anusheel.gurjar on Instagram.

> If the tool doesn't work, download and install OpenJDK17 from this url https://adoptium.net/
  and try running it again

> Currently, output size is limited to 800 x 800 px. If you wish to scale the output:
  	1. Import the render in Photoshop
	2. Go to Image > Image Size and choose Resample: Nearest Neighbor (hard edges)
	3. Input desired size into width and height and it's done

> The output naming also stores the data. This is how to read it:
  "output" + threshold + contrast + pixel_size_x + pixel_size_y + matrix_size_x + matrix_size_y + rotate + image 1 scale + image 2 scale
